# UC Merced Image Classification

This project was developed to classify aerial images from the UC Merced Land Use Dataset using deep learning techniques. The purpose of this project is to compare the results obtained by fine-tuning GoogLeNet with training a simple neural network.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/uc-merced-image-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd uc-merced-image-classification
    ```
3. Install the required libraries.

## Usage
To use the image classification system, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare your dataset by placing the images in the appropriate directories.
2. Run the classification and evaluation using the provided Jupyter notebooks:
    - `uc-merced-googlenet.ipynb` for GoogLeNet classification.
    - `uc-merced-mlp.ipynb` for MLP classification.
